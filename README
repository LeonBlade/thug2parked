THUG2 Park Editor

This is a personal project I'm working on to create parks for THUG2 without using the in game editor, enabling you to do things like stacking and what not.

Trying to keep this project straight C if I can just because I feel like it.
Makefile currently is setup using frameworks because I'm on OS X.
Some functions need to get their own files and an overall cleanup.
This is still being worked on so not everything is as it will be later on.

Some things to look at would be the structs for t2cap.
